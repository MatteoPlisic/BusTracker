// This document outlines the features, architecture, and design for a cross-country
// bus tracking application in Croatia.

== Architectural Overview

The application will be developed using a modern, multi-platform technology stack, separated into three distinct services that communicate via a RESTful API.

=== Backend Service
A **Java Spring Boot** application responsible for all business logic, database interactions, and real-time data distribution. The architecture follows a standard three-layer pattern:

*   *Controller Layer:* Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates to the service layer. Contains no business logic.
*   *Service Layer:* Contains the core application logic, orchestrating data flow and business rules.
*   *Repository Layer:* Manages all data access and communication with the PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA.

=== Web Frontend
A **React with TypeScript** single-page application (SPA) providing a responsive user interface for web browsers. The project will be structured using a feature-centric approach for scalability and maintainability. Key directories include:

*   `api/`: Centralized logic for all communication with the backend.
*   `components/`: Shared, reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Map).
*   `features/`: Components specific to a single feature (e.g., BusFilter, TripDetails).
*   `pages/`: Top-level components that represent a full page or route.
*   `types/`: Centralized TypeScript type and interface definitions mirroring backend DTOs.

=== Android Frontend
A native **Kotlin** application built with modern Android practices. It follows the Google-recommended **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

*   *UI Layer:* Built with **Jetpack Compose**. It is responsible for displaying state and forwarding user events. It observes state from the ViewModel using `StateFlow`.
*   *ViewModel Layer:* Contains UI-related logic and exposes UI state. Survives configuration changes and communicates with the Data Layer.
*   *Data Layer:* Provides a single source of truth for application data. It is composed of:
** *Repositories:* The main entry point for data access for the ViewModels.
** *Remote Data Sources:* Uses the **Retrofit** library to make network calls to the Spring Boot backend.
*   *Dependency Injection:* Uses **Hilt** to manage dependencies between layers, promoting decoupling and testability.

The project structure will be a hybrid model: the UI layer is packaged by feature (e.g., `map`, `schedule`), while the shared Data Layer is packaged by layer (`repository`, `model`, `remote`).

== Core Features (Version 1.0)

The initial version of the application will focus on delivering a seamless and intuitive bus tracking experience.

=== Live Bus Location on Map
The primary feature. Users can view a map with bus icons moving in near real-time. Clicking an icon reveals detailed information.

=== Filtering by Company and Line
Users can filter the buses shown on the map. The filtering logic will be hierarchical:
. The user first selects a bus company (*FlexingBus*, *Departa*, *Brijuni Trans*).
. The UI then updates to show only the lines operated by that company.
. The user can optionally select a specific line to focus on.

=== Trip Details and Stop ETA
When a user selects a specific bus, detailed information about its current trip will be displayed.

*   The bus's line number and route name will be clearly shown (e.g., *Line 345: Rijeka -> Split*).
*   The full route path will be highlighted visually on the map.
*   An information panel will list all *upcoming* stops for the current trip.
*   For each upcoming stop, an **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)** will be displayed.
*   The ETA calculation will be based on the bus's current location, its average speed, and the distance to the upcoming stops along the defined route.
*   Stops that the bus has already passed will be visually distinguished (e.g., grayed out or marked with a check).

=== Timetable/Schedule View
To allow users to plan their travel, a simple timetable view will be available.

*   Users can search for a route (e.g., by selecting a departure and destination city).
*   The application will display a list of all scheduled trips for that route for the current day.
*   Each entry will show the line number, departure time, and scheduled arrival time.

== Discussion: User Authentication

*Decision for v1.0:* **NO, user accounts will NOT be required.**

*Rationale:* The core value is instant, anonymous access to tracking information. Registration is a barrier to entry for a demo product.

*Future Consideration (v2.0):* User accounts will be added later to enable personalized features like saving favorite routes and setting up notifications.

== Future Enhancements & Feature Roadmap

*   User Accounts & Profiles
*   Favorite Routes/Buses
*   Real-time Notifications (e.g., "bus is 15 mins away")
*   Administrator Panel (for managing data without database access)
*   Historical Trip Playback

== Preliminary Data Models

The following data models will form the core of the backend database schema.

=== Company
*   `id` (Primary Key)
*   `name` (e.g., "FlexingBus")

=== Bus
*   `id` (Primary Key)
*   `licensePlate` (e.g., "RI-1234-ZG")
*   `companyId` (Foreign Key to Company)
*   `currentTripId` (Foreign Key to Trip, nullable)

=== Stop
*   `id` (Primary Key)
*   `name` (e.g., "Autobusni Kolodvor Zagreb")
*   `latitude`
*   `longitude`

=== Route
*   `id` (Primary Key)
*   `lineNumber` (String, e.g., "345" or "102A")
*   `name` (e.g., "Rijeka - Split Direct")
*   `stops` (An ordered list of Stop IDs, representing the journey path)

=== Trip
*   `id` (Primary Key)
*   `routeId` (Foreign Key to Route)
*   `busId` (Foreign Key to Bus)
*   `departureTime` (Timestamp, e.g., '2023-11-08T08:00:00Z')
*   `status` (Enum: SCHEDULED, DEPARTED, ARRIVED, CANCELLED)

=== BusLocation
*   `busId` (Primary Key / Foreign Key)
*   `latitude`
*   `longitude`
*   `timestamp`
*   `speed` (Optional)
